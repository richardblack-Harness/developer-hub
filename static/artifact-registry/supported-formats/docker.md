### First heading
Only show the ToC for the currently selected markdown file.
When the user switches tabs, the ToC updates to reflect the headings in the currently loaded markdown.
This is the most intuitive for users, as the ToC always matches the visible content.
How to implement:

Use a markdown renderer (or a library) that can parse headings from the loaded markdown and generate a ToC.
Render the ToC above or beside the markdown content.
When the selected tab changes, regenerate the ToC for the new content.
